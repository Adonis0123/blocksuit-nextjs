export const presetMarkdown = `This playground is designed to:

* 📝 Test basic editing experience.
* ⚙️ Serve as E2E test entry.
* 🔗 Demonstrate how BlockSuite reconciles real-time collaboration with [local-first](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf) data ownership.

## Controlling Playground Data Source
You might initially enter this page with the \`?init\` URL param. This is the default (opt-in) setup that automatically loads this built-in article. Meanwhile, you'll connect to a random single-user room via a WebRTC provider by default. This is the "single-user mode" for local testing.;

> Note that the second and subsequent users should not open the page with the \`?init\` param in this case. Also, due to the P2P nature of WebRTC, as long as there is at least one user connected to the room, the content inside the room will **always** exist.
